  <h2>Presentation Abstracts</h2>

  <h3>Session 1</h3>Panagiotis Gkikopoulos (UniNE)<br />
  <i>Data-Centric Consensus in Smart Cities</i>

  <p>Smart cities operate large networks of devices and sensors. They produce large
  amounts of data critical for the reliable operation of services. Such data-driven
  systems are susceptible to data quality issues, especially when AI models are involved.
  Data-Centric Consensus is a proposed combination of multi-view data fusion and data
  cleansing to improve data quality by filling gaps and resolving conflicts. We present
  and evaluate the DCC methodology, focusing on conflict resolution using voting. We then
  showcase 2 application fields, indoor localisation in smart shopping and people flow
  tracking in public transport.</p>Peterson Yuhala (UniNE)<br />
  <i>Securing IoT Peripherals with Trusted Execution Environments and Machine
  Learning</i>

  <p>With the increasing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, security
  concerns have become a major challenge: confidential information, e.g., speech, images,
  etc. is constantly being transmitted (sometimes inadvertently) from user devices to
  untrusted cloud services. We propose a design to enhance security and privacy in IoT
  based systems by isolating hardware peripheral drivers in a trusted execution
  environment (TEE), and leveraging secure machine learning classification techniques to
  filter out sensitive data (i.e., speech, images, etc.) from the associated peripheral
  device before it makes its way to an untrusted party in the cloud. We provide a
  proof-of-concept implementation of our security design with secure sound processing via
  I2S.</p>R&eacute;mi Dulong and Nathan Felber(UniNE)<br />
  <i>RDMA enhanced by In-Network features</i>

  <p>Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) protocols, designed to provide fast transfers and
  low latencies over entire clusters have been in use for two decades. The main ones
  (InfiniBand and iWarp) evolved and followed the constant evolution of networks over the
  years, through compatible hardware such as network interfaces (NICs) and switches.
  Nowadays, this hardware can reach 100Gbit/s, or even 400Gbit/s. However, the feature
  set of RDMA remains limited. Implementing some advanced features in a pure software
  fashion can severely reduce performance, if the said feature does not comply with basic
  RDMA operations workflow. That is why we try to use a programmable switch (Intel
  Tofino) to implement these features in the network itself.</p>

  <h3>Session 2</h3>J&auml;mes M&eacute;n&eacute;trey (UniNE)<br />
  <i>A Cross-platform Pub/Sub system with Attestation</i>

  <p>We explore the integration of attestation mechanisms into pub/sub systems to enhance
  security, transparency, and the verifiability of message exchanges within distributed
  computing environments.</p>Vincenzo Di Perna (UniNE)<br />
  <i>Enhancing Blockchain System Evaluation through Extended DiabloBench Support for
  Kollapse: A Case Study on Expiring Money and Economic Circulation</i>

  <p>Blockchain technology has ushered in a new era for distributed systems by offering
  decentralization and security. However, assessing the performance and functionalities
  of diverse blockchain systems presents a formidable challenge, owing to the
  resource-intensive nature of benchmarking and the scarcity of comprehensive literature.
  The need for substantial hardware and economic resources for result replication often
  surpasses practical feasibility, leading to constrained evaluations. Moreover, the
  absence of functional systems and repositories compounds these limitations. This
  presentation tackles the intricate problem of resource-intensive evaluations within the
  context of blockchain systems benchmarking. We introduce an inventive strategy that
  involves the expansion of the DiabloBench benchmarking framework to natively
  incorporate support for Kollapse, an experimental environment tailored for testing
  distributed systems. Focusing on the domain of programmable money, which empowers the
  implementation of customized code and parameters to define behavioral attributes, we
  delve into the evaluation of blockchain systems. Specifically, we scrutinize the
  incorporation of an expiration mechanism, wherein time constraints are associated with
  monetary units. Our analysis seeks to determine whether this approach stimulates
  economic circulation and incentivizes the judicious utilization of financial resources.
  Our endeavor not only streamlines benchmarking procedures but also facilitates
  equitable comparisons across different blockchain systems. In effect, this presentation
  advocates for the progression of distributed systems by addressing the challenge of
  costly evaluation. Through our proposed methodology, we contribute to the advancement
  of blockchain technology and its potential impact on economic mechanisms.</p>Alisson
  Medeiros (UniBE)<br />
  <i>Flow Latency and Throughput Aware Sensitive Routing for 6DoF VR</i>

  <p>The next generation of Virtual Reality (VR) applications is expected to provide
  advanced experiences through Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) content, which requires latency
  and throughput guarantees. This research presents a novel method for optimizing the
  latency performance for DoF VR applications by calculating paths based on their latency
  requirement. The proposed approach (FLATWISE) balances the shortest and widest paths to
  minimize the overall latency performance for all DoF VR applications. We investigate
  the Joint Flow Allocation (JFA) problem to find paths for all flows in a network such
  that it determines the optimal paths for each flow in terms of throughput and latency.
  FLATWISE allocates paths for flows with latency close to the latency required by flow
  while satisfying the flow throughput requirement. To evaluate the effectiveness of
  FLATWISE, extensive simulations were con- ducted and compared against state-of-the-art
  routing algorithms. The results demonstrate that FLATWISE significantly improves flow
  latency reduction, over-provisioned latency reduction, end- to-end (E2E) latency
  reduction, flow throughput enhancement, frame rate enhancement, and algorithm execution
  time reduction.</p>Dimitrios Xenakis (UniBE)<br />
  <i>Iterative Inlier Selection (IIS) for Flip-Ambiguity Mitigation in Cooperative
  Localization</i>

  <p>Enhancing the accuracy of positioning estimations in wireless sensor networks
  remains an active area of research. One effective strategy is enabling sensors to
  collaborate during their positioning, known as Cooperative Localization (CL). In our
  prior work, we introduced the ARLCL framework, which offers superior performance when
  compared to the alternative approaches. However, a consistent challenge across CL
  techniques is the flip-ambiguity problem which manifests when the positioning of
  individual node-neighborhoods is accurate, yet the relations between different
  neighborhoods are incorrect because of their relative misplacement and wrong
  orientation. To address this, we propose a correcting method based on Iterative Inlier
  Selection (IIS) that is designed to mitigate such errors. Evaluating the efficacy of
  IIS, we undertook a real-world deployment experiment spanning a floor of 500m2, using
  40 UWB nodes. Our results showed that IIS improved the performance of all assessed CL
  methods by up to 50%. Furthermore, the utility of IIS extends beyond CL and is relevant
  for any scientific domain confronted with inlier/outlier selection.</p>

  <h3>Session 3</h3>Zimu Xu (UniBE)<br />
  <i>Predicting Personality Traits from Device Usage via Semi-supervised Federated
  Learning</i>

  <p>In the era of ubiquitous computing, smart devices are deeply ingrained in our daily
  routines. Their extensive interaction logs can provide profound insights into user
  behavior and, potentially, their personality traits. A potential forthcoming study is
  poised to leverage device usage data for personality prediction, with a focus on
  privacy-preservation through Federated Learning (FL) techniques. Given the challenge of
  obtaining sufficient labeled data through personality questionnaires, I introduce a
  semi-supervised approach within the federated learning paradigm. This method allows for
  utilizing both labeled (from the limited questionnaires) and unlabeled data
  (large-scale device usage logs) in a decentralized manner, offering a promising
  solution to the problem of incomplete labeling. This approach ensures that raw user
  data never leaves the device, addressing potential privacy concerns.</p>Jesutofunmi
  Ajayi (UniBE)<br />
  <i>Learning Competitive Algorithms for Network Slice Provisioning</i>

  <p>The capabilities of 5G Mobile Networks are expected to be bolstered by the
  virtualization of the network infrastructure, as well as the integration of edge-based
  computing systems into the telco environment. As a result, Network Slicing has recently
  emerged as a novel virtualized infrastructure model in which heterogeneous services can
  be simultaneously provisioned over a common mobile network infrastructure. The
  provisioning of such services in the 5G network, however, is preceded by their
  admission which is a critical decision-making mechanism during slice preparation since
  it determines whether or not upcoming network slice requests can be admitted into the
  system. In this presentation, we explore this problem and look at how Bandit Learning
  can be leveraged to adaptively select admission control policies, in the form of
  competitive algorithms, towards the admission and provisioning of Network Slices in 5G
  mobile networks.</p>Eric Samikwa (UniBE)<br />
  <i>Dynamic Federated Learning: Navigating Data and Resource Heterogeneity in Edge IoT
  Environments</i>

  <p>Federated Learning (FL) in edge Internet of Things (IoT) environments is challenging
  due to the heterogeneous nature of the learning environment, primarily embodied in two
  aspects. Firstly, the data gathered from geographically dispersed clients often
  exhibits statistical heterogeneity, usually non-independent and identically
  distributed, which can deteriorate the FL training accuracy. Secondly, the
  heterogeneous computing and communication resources available across IoT devices
  introduce instability in training processes. This instability results in prolonged
  global model convergence times and compromises energy efficiency. While existing
  solutions tend to address only one facet of this heterogeneity issue, they overlook the
  conjoined challenge of resource and data heterogeneity, particularly concerning IoT
  systems with constrained resources. We introduce Dynamic Federated Learning (DFL) as a
  solution to confront the dual problem of data and resource heterogeneity for
  distributed training in edge IoT. DFL operates through a fusion of resource-aware split
  computing for deep neural networks and a dynamic clustering mechanism. The latter
  clusters training participants based on the similarity of their sub-model layers,
  fostering collaboration. Results demonstrate the efficacy of DFL in enhancing key
  training parameters, including training time, accuracy, and energy consumption, in
  heterogeneous learning landscapes characterized by data and resource heterogeneity.</p>

  <h3>Session 4</h3>Ana Leni Frei (UniBE)<br />
  <i>Geometric deep learning for epithelial cell classification from H&amp;E images in
  rectal cancer and tumor microenvironment analysis</i>

  <p>Cell-level tissue analysis are often used in digital histopathology to study tissue
  structure and composition. Nowadays, available datasets and models for automatic cell
  segmentation and classification exist but lack the differentiation of epithelial cells
  into normal and malignant. This distinction can be challenging due to the high
  morphologic heterogeneity of malignant cells. To tackle this, we developed an
  epithelial cell-based graph node classification model to leverage both local cell
  features and overall tissue architecture to accurately classify epithelial cell. The
  proposed method showed excellent F1 score performance on two test sets and performed
  significantly better than conventional computer vision methods (p &lt; 0.05). This
  highlights that structural context, captured by graphs, is an important feature for
  epithelial cell classification. Furthermore, the proposed model can be applied on top
  of any other method that identifies epithelial cells to further differentiate between
  normal and malignant cells and gain more insight about tissue composition. Based on
  this, fully automated cell-level analysis can be applied on biopsies and resections of
  rectal cancer patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapies to study
  tumor microenvironenment, tumor characteristics and study treatment
  response.</p>Pasquale De Rosa (UniNE)<br />
  <i>Using Machine Learning Techniques for Accurate Link Predictions on Large-Scale
  Dynamic Graphs</i>

  <p>Graphs are structures made of vertices (nodes) and edges (links). Most real-world
  graphs are dynamic, i.e. their structure progressively change over time. A dynamic
  graph can also be viewed as a time series, where additional links continuously form
  between new or existing nodes over a specific period of time. My study is focusing on
  the analysis of ML-based algorithms to forecast the generation of new links on such
  dynamic graphs. My aim is to propose a new link prediction algorithm capable of
  outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches (i.e. GCNs, GraphSAGE, HinSAGE) in this
  specific task. This new algorithm will further be used in real-world applications, such
  as predicting the generation of new links on dynamic blockchain graphs.</p>

  <h3>Session 5</h3>
  Chuyang Gao (UniBE)<br />
  <i>Reinforcement Learning based Joint Optimization for Edge Caching in Mobile immersive
  communication.</i>

  <p>Edge caching in immersive communication is an effective solution for reducing
  traffic congestion and minimizing access delay to popular content. However, finding the
  optimal cache decision policy poses challenges. This paper proposes an approach to
  address these challenges by offering three key contributions. Firstly, it reduces
  computational complexity, enabling real-time decision making by combining optimization
  techniques with data-driven AI algorithms. Secondly, our approach supports partial
  caching, enabling more effective utilization of cached content among multiple users and
  enhancing multi-user video caching. Thirdly, it directly predicts the optimal caching
  strategy, eliminating the need for content popularity comparisons and considering
  network bandwidth and storage capacity constraints for content replacement.
  Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in terms of
  computational efficiency, reducing latency and improved caching efficiency through
  partial caching.</p>Simon Queyrut (UniNE)<br />
  <i>KillerDroid-robust Malware Detectors</i>

  <p>The Android operating system's remarkably widespread adoption has brought about a
  concerning proliferation of malware within the Android ecosystem. This surge in
  malicious software propagation presents a serious challenge, underscoring the need to
  effectively detect such threats. Still, the reported outcomes in the field of malware
  static analysis, along with existing solutions, have shown a tendency to greatly
  overestimate their actual efficacy. In a recent study, a novel methodology for
  generating a very large amount of realistic, carefully crafted edge cases of Android
  malwares is presented. The obfuscation suite manages to elude cutting-edge scanners
  both within academic and industry domains. We explain the inefficiency of the current
  generation of antiviruses in the face of the new adversarial software generator and set
  the groundwork for an efficient malware detector through learning and rule-based
  methods.</p>Mingjing Sun (UniBE)<br />
  <i>Networking for Immersive Communications: Floating Service</i>

  <p>The vision of immersive communication is to enable interactions with remote people
  and environments such that users get the impression to be really inside a remote or
  virtual environment. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are key
  technologies to enable immersive communications. However, immersive applications
  supported by multiple edge computing devices (MEC) becomes complicated when service
  users become highly mobile, e.g. in the case of users moving in vehicles such as cars
  and trains. In this way, services have to be migrated among edge servers. We aim to
  consider the development of the Floating Services (FS) concept to address the problem
  of finding and deploying services.</p>

  <h3>Session 6</h3>S&eacute;bastien Rumley (HES)<br />
  <i>Energy efficiency of internet traffic - models and bound</i>

  <p>The Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector is increasingly
  scrutinized and indicted for its role in carbon emissions, which could amount to those
  of the aviation sector. In this context, it is crucial for the ICT community (industry,
  academia, users&hellip;) to develop a solid understanding of their energy consumptions
  and CO2 footprint. In my talk, I will consider the energy consumption of internet
  traffic, and I will suggest how to approximate a lower bound for it. In the first part
  of the talk, I will focus on network transport. I review optical WDM links
  architectures and perform a breakdown of the power consumption per component. In
  particular, I will show that achieving a link consuming less than 1pJ/bit is
  challenging, and that over long distances, the consumption can be expected to be
  superior to 100pJ/bit/1000km. I will show how physical limits can be used to validate
  these lower bounds. In the second part of the talk, I will consider the consumption of
  network routing. Using examples taken from High Performance Computing, I will propose
  an approach to approximate the lower bound for routing. I will then hypothesize how far
  we are from these lower bounds in the wild, and finally conclude on where, in my
  opinion, research efforts should be directed to reduce overall internet
  consumption.</p>ALL<br />
